# python-OOPs-concepts
- Pillars of OOPs are as follows  
  1.Encapsulation  
  2.Abstraction  
  3.Polymorphism  
  4.Inheritance  

  To implement the oops using these four pillars we need three more component  
  1. Class  
  2. Object or instance  
  3. Reference
 
     what is class?

     A class is a set of specifications or blueprint about an entity. it defines a set of data elements and methods also called as attributes and behaviors.

     use class keyboard to create a class.
    * Attributes are the variables that belong to a class
    * Attributes are always public and can be accessed using dot(.) operator. Eg. myclass.myatribute
    * Example :Creating an empty class in python

    * Objects or instance
       The objects is an entity that has a state and behsvior associateed with it.
    * Creating an objects
       to create an object we need special method called as** constructor**
       **constructor** is a method inside a class having some special features
      1. Same name as class name
      2. No return in type
      3.Used to initialize fields of an object
  **creating an object**
      * Static BInding
      * Dynamic Binding

    ** Static Binding** -Compiler know about memory occupied by an object.
    ** Dynamic Binding** -Memory is allocated at run time using***new** keyword
    Example : **static binding**
